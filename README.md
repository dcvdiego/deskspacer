# DeskSpacer

![Logo](https://github.com/dcvdiego/deskspacer/blob/main/public/logo.svg?raw=true)
Inspired by deskspacing.com, deskspacer allows you to draft your dream setup before you actually get it!

> [!WARNING]  
> This project is currently under heavy development. An alpha release is in the works soon. Build at your own risk!

## Features

- Wide-range of 3D models for peripherals and accessories
- Mobile-friendly :)
- Full transform any 3D model available with axis and transform mode restrictions!
- Various settings available to tweak your experience

## Demo

Coming soon!

## Roadmap

- Prebuilt rooms to tinker with without starting from scratch

- Share your creations a-la pcpartpicker (loading overlay needs a start from scratch button)

- Component Editor: Make your dream peripheral :D

- Scaling to affect the right things for certain devices (y-axis for tables just the legs, xz tabletop, diagonally for monitors only, potentially snap to aspect ratio)

- BYOC, upload your own component, add it to the environment! (Might have to involve user registration to store GLBs?)
